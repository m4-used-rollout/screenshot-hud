# Screenshot HUD

Builds with Visual Studio 2019. To use, select the display you will be capturing from. Open the Editor to add screens to detect. Each screen is made up of a set of points/colors that are used to detect when the screen is visible. You can have it screenshot the entire screen to disk, and/or you can set up Capture Boxes that will copy a portion of the detected screen to the Destination X/Y on the HUD panel. Streaming and recording software like OBS can capture the HUD panel either all at once or in parts to place the HUD how you want it.

This tool was originally written for TPP to use during their Brilliant Diamond run. A second display was used for OBS to project the Switch capture onto, and then the Screenshot HUD referenced that for all its screens.
